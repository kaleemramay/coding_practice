## Counting bits and numbers to binary
What does this do?

Takes number in given argument and counts the number of bits needed to reprsent it in binary. 

    There are 6 bits in number 45

values and and converts the number to binary

    There are 6 bits in number 45
    binary value of 45 is 101101

Also works for really big numbers

    There are 59 bits in number 567890876567890876
    binary value of 567890876567890876 is 11111100001100011011011111001010001000000111010101110111100
